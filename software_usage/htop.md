# htop

`htop` is a free (GPL) ncurses-based process viewer for Linux. It is similar to top, but allows you to scroll vertically and horizontally, so you can see all the processes running on the system, along with their full command lines.

## Find out which CPU core a process is running on

* Execute `htop -p <pid>`.
* Press <F2> key, got to "Columns", add PROCESSOR under "Available Columns".
* The currently used CPU ID of the process will appear under "CPU" column.
